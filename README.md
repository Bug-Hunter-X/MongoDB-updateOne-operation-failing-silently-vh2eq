This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB update operations. The `updateOne` function is used to update a document in the collection. However, the code fails silently if no document matches the query filter. This is because the `upsert` option is missing, so no new document is created when no existing document matches the filter. The solution shows how to use the `upsert` option correctly to resolve this issue.
